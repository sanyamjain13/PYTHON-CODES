    EXPLAINATION :-
    
    N= NO OF TEST CASES
    LIST1 CONTAINS VALUE OF K AND N WHERE K=NO OF TEAMS THAT CAN QUALIFY AND N=NO OF TEAMS PARTICIPATED WHERE SCORES ARE GIVEN
    LIST2 CONTAINS THE SCORES OF ALL THE TEAMS
    WE SORT THE SCORES IN DESCENDING ORDER AND WITH THE GIVEN VALUE OF K WE KNOW THAT TOP K TEAMS WILL BE QUALIFIED
    WE NEED TO CHECK IF THERE IS A TEAM WITH THE SCORE EQUAL TO THE LAST SELECTED TEAM
    FOR EG- IF N=5 AND K=1, MEANS 5 TEAMS SCORE WILL BE GIVEN AND ONLY TOP 1 TEAM WILL BE QUALIFIED
    SO IF THE SCORE OF TOP 1ST TEAM IS EQUAL TO ANY OTHER TEAM OR THERE IS A TIE BETWEEN THE TEAMS THEN THE VALUE OF K WILL BE INCREMENTED
    
    SCORES (N) = 5 5 4 3 2
    K=1, SO FIRST TOP TEAM WILL BE QUALIFIED BUT THE SECOND TEAM HAS THE SAME SCORE SO THIS TEAM WILL BE QUALIFIED AS WELL.
    
    SO WE NEED TO SHOW THE NO OF TEAMS QUALIFIED AS OUR OUTPUT
    SO OUTPUT HERE COMES IS->  2
